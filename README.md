# Web of Well-Being: Re-Examining PERMA and Subjective Well-Being Through Networks



## Abstract
The science of well-being lives at the heart of positive psychology. While the field has been around for 20 years, positive psychologists still face the challenge of finding optimal measurements of well-being. The PERMA framework (Seligman, 2011; 2018) can provide for a measurement model, but its added value in terms of being distinct from the already established measurement scale of Subjective Well-being (SWB; Deiner et al., 1999) has been under debate (Goodman et al., 2018). However, certain characteristics of PERMA make it unsuited for traditional factor analysis. In this paper we argue that a network approach is more suitable to understand the interrelational  nature among the components of PERMA. We begin our investigation of PERMA by replicating Goodman and colleagues (2018) work. We then fit PERMA and two additional components to a network model. We then show how the components PERMA and SWB are distinct using exploratory graphical analysis. Our results show that while PERMA and SWB measure the same “type” of well-being, PERMA provides a measure that helps us understand the relationships that make up well-being that we refer to as the web of well-being.
